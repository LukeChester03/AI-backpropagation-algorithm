#Backpropagation Algorithm for Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains an implementation of the backpropagation algorithm for training artificial neural networks. The code is written in Python and uses the NumPy library for efficient numerical operations.

#Background
The backpropagation algorithm is a supervised learning method used for training artificial neural networks. It involves computing the gradients of a loss function with respect to the parameters of the network, and then updating those parameters using gradient descent. The algorithm is called "backpropagation" because the gradients are computed starting from the output layer and then propagated backwards through the network.
